# VBRotations
Interactive SVG for Volleyball playbooks, built using Snap.


# Todo
- Add a legend
- Add a toggle or hover that visualizes the rotation requirements - i.e. what a player has to worry about and which players they have to take notice of to stay in a valid rotation.
- Instructions
- education "video" that stitches together some rotations
- Resize to fit
- Dynamic offsets and placement
- Attack/Cover and defense plays
- Should the "action" be sticky when switching rotations?
- Keyboard shortcuts?  Can javascript catch them?
